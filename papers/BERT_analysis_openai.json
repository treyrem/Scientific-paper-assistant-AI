      "content": "arXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019\n\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce fine-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-specific parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the fine-tuning approaches.\nThe ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying fine-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder\nRepresentations\nfrom\nTransformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a \u201cmasked lan-\nguage model\u201d (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).\nThe\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\n\nword based only on its context.\nUnlike left-to-\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n\n\u2022 We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\nspecific architectures. BERT is the first fine-\ntuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\nforming many task-specific architectures.\n\n\u2022 BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\nNLP tasks.\nThe code and pre-trained mod-\nels are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/bert.\n\nThese approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\n2014).\nTo train sentence representations, prior\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\ntence words given a representation of the previous\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\nwith existing task-specific architectures, ELMo\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\ndict a single word from both left and right context\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\nels.\n\n2.2\nUnsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\n\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\nguage representations, and we briefly review the\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\n\n2.1\nUnsupervised Feature-based Approaches\n\nLearning widely applicable representations of\nwords has been an active area of research for\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\n2014) methods.\nPre-trained word embeddings\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\nfering significant improvements over embeddings\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\n\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the first\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text\n(Col-\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\nwhich produce contextual token representations\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\nfine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\nscratch.\nAt least partly due to this advantage,\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\net al., 2018a).\nLeft-to-right language model-\n\nSQuAD\n\nNER\nMNLI\n\nNSP\nMask LM\nMask LM\n\nStart/End Span\n\nC\n\nC\n\nT1\n\nTN\n\nT1\u2019\n...\n\nTM\u2019\n\nT1\n\nTN\n\nT1\u2019\n...\n\nTM\u2019\n\nT[SEP]\n...\n\nT[SEP]\n...",

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\ntures are used in both pre-training and fine-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During fine-tuning, all parameters are fine-tuned. [CLS] is a special\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\ntions/answers).\n\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the final downstream architecture.\n\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\n\n2.3\nTransfer Learning from Supervised Data\n\nModel Architecture\nBERT\u2019s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d2\n\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\nis to fine-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\n\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\n\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\n\n1https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/filter size to be 4H,\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\n\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\nframework: pre-training and fine-tuning.\nDur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks.\nFor fine-\ntuning, the BERT model is first initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate fine-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\n\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a \u201cmasked\nLM\u201d (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\ncase, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\nstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\nfine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\npear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\nnot always replace \u201cmasked\u201d words with the ac-\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\n\nInput/Output Representations\nTo make BERT\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\n(e.g., \u27e8Question, Answer \u27e9) in one token sequence.\nThroughout this work, a \u201csentence\u201d can be an arbi-\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\nlinguistic sentence. A \u201csequence\u201d refers to the in-\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\nsification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\ngregate sequence representation for classification\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as E, the final hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C \u2208RH,\nand the final hidden vector for the ith input token\nas Ti \u2208RH.\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n\n3.1\nPre-training BERT\n\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\n\nTask #1: Masked LM\nIntuitively, it is reason-\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\nright and a right-to-left model.\nUnfortunately,\nstandard conditional language models can only be\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\ndirectly \u201csee itself\u201d, and the model could trivially\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\n\nTask #2:\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP)\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\nated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically,\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext).\nAs we show\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\ntion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\ntask is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6\n\nformer is often referred to as a \u201cTransformer encoder\u201d while\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a \u201cTransformer\ndecoder\u201d since it can be used for text generation.\n\n5The final model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\nwithout fine-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\n\n[CLS]\nhe\nlikes\nplay\n##ing\n[SEP]\nmy\ndog\nis\ncute\n[SEP]\nInput\n\nE[CLS]\nEhe\nElikes\nEplay\nE##ing\nE[SEP]\nEmy\nEdog\nEis\nEcute\nE[SEP]\nToken\nEmbeddings\n\nEA\nEB\nEB\nEB\nEB\nEB\nEA\nEA\nEA\nEA\nEA\nSegment\nEmbeddings\n\nE0\nE6\nE7\nE8\nE9\nE10\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nPosition\nEmbeddings\n\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\n\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\n\n(4) a degenerate text-\u2205pair in text classification\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\ninto an output layer for classification, such as en-\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is rela-\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de-\nscribe the task-specific details in the correspond-\ning subsections of Section 4.

The right part of the paper represents the\nDev set results. For the feature-based approach,\nwe concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the\nfeatures, which was shown to be the best approach\nin Section 5.3.\nFrom the table it can be seen that fine-tuning is\nsurprisingly robust to different masking strategies.\nHowever, as expected, using only the MASK strat-\negy was problematic when applying the feature-\nbased approach to NER. Interestingly, using only\nthe RND strategy performs much worse than our\nstrategy as well.\n\n78\n\nMNLI Dev Accuracy\n\n76\n\nBERTBASE (Masked LM)\nBERTBASE (Left-to-Right)\n\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n\nPre-training Steps (Thousands)\n\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps.

      "content": "Pre-training data The pre-training procedure\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\nshuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\nextract long contiguous sequences.\n\nIn this section, we present BERT fine-tuning re-\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\n\n3.2\nFine-tuning BERT\n\n4.1\nGLUE\n\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\nTo fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\nas described in Section 3, and use the final hid-\nden vector C \u2208RH corresponding to the first\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\nfine-tuning are classification layer weights W \u2208\nRK\u00d7H, where K is the number of labels. We com-\npute a standard classification loss with C and W,\ni.e., log(softmax(CW T )).\n\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\nF1 score of 91.0%.\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\n\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks\u2014\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs\u2014by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and fine-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.\nAt the in-\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\n\nSystem\nMNLI-(m/mm)\nQQP\nQNLI\nSST-2\nCoLA\nSTS-B\nMRPC\nRTE\nAverage\n392k\n363k\n108k\n67k\n8.5k\n5.7k\n3.5k\n2.5k\n-\nPre-OpenAI SOTA\n80.6/80.1\n66.1\n82.3\n93.2\n35.0\n81.0\n86.0\n61.7\n74.0\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn\n76.4/76.1\n64.8\n79.8\n90.4\n36.0\n73.3\n84.9\n56.8\n71.0\nOpenAI GPT\n82.1/81.4\n70.3\n87.4\n91.3\n45.4\n80.0\n82.3\n56.0\n75.1\nBERTBASE\n84.6/83.4\n71.2\n90.5\n93.5\n52.1\n85.8\n88.9\n66.4\n79.6\nBERTLARGE\n86.7/85.9\n72.1\n92.7\n94.9\n60.5\n86.5\n89.3\n70.1\n82.1\n\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The \u201cAverage\u201d column is slightly different\nthan the official GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-\nmodel, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and\naccuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\n\nWe use a batch size of 32 and fine-tune for 3\nepochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each\ntask, we selected the best fine-tuning learning rate\n(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.\nAdditionally, for BERTLARGE we found that fine-\ntuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\nbest model on the Dev set. With random restarts,\nwe use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per-\nform different fine-tuning data shuffling and clas-\nsifier layer initialization.9\n\nWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to\npredict the answer text span in the passage.\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answer-\ning task, we represent the input question and pas-\nsage as a single packed sequence, with the ques-\ntion using the A embedding and the passage using\nthe B embedding. We only introduce a start vec-\ntor S \u2208RH and an end vector E \u2208RH during\nfine-tuning. The probability of word i being the\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\nuct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi =\neS\u00b7Ti\n\ufffd\nj eS\u00b7Tj .\n\nResults are presented in Table 1.\nBoth\nBERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all sys-\ntems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining\n4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy im-\nprovement over the prior state of the art. Note that\nBERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical\nin terms of model architecture apart from the at-\ntention masking. For the largest and most widely\nreported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6%\nabsolute accuracy improvement. On the official\nGLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score\nof 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains\n72.8 as of the date of writing.\nWe find that BERTLARGE significantly outper-\nforms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those\nwith very little training data. The effect of model\nsize is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\n\n4.2\nSQuAD v1.1\n\nThe\nStanford\nQuestion\nAnswering\nDataset\n(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd-\nsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,\n2016).\nGiven a question and a passage from\n\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\nposition i to position j is defined as S\u00b7Ti + E\u00b7Tj,\nand the maximum scoring span where j \u2265i is\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\nend positions. We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the\nSQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public\nsystem descriptions available,11 and are allowed to\nuse any public data when training their systems.\nWe therefore use modest data augmentation in\nour system by first fine-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshi\net al., 2017) befor fine-tuning on SQuAD.\nOur best performing system outperforms the top\nleaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and\n+1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single\nBERT model outperforms the top ensemble sys-\ntem in terms of F1 score.

Given a sen-\ntence, the task is to choose the most plausible con-\ntinuation among four choices.\nWhen fine-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we\nconstruct four input sequences, each containing\nthe concatenation of the given sentence (sentence\nA) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The\nonly task-specific parameters introduced is a vec-\ntor whose dot product with the [CLS] token rep-\nresentation C denotes a score for each choice\nwhich is normalized with a softmax layer.\nWe fine-tune the model for 3 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16. Re-\nsults are presented in Table 4. BERTLARGE out-\nperforms the authors\u2019 baseline ESIM+ELMo sys-\ntem by +27.1% and OpenAI GPT by 8.3%.\n\nThe SQuAD 2.0 task extends the SQuAD 1.1\nproblem definition by allowing for the possibility\nthat no short answer exists in the provided para-\ngraph, making the problem more realistic.\nWe use a simple approach to extend the SQuAD\nv1.1 BERT model for this task. We treat ques-\ntions that do not have an answer as having an an-\nswer span with start and end at the [CLS] to-\nken. The probability space for the start and end\nanswer span positions is extended to include the\nposition of the [CLS] token. For prediction, we\ncompare the score of the no-answer span: snull =\nS\u00b7C + E\u00b7C to the score of the best non-null span\n\n12The TriviaQA data we used consists of paragraphs from\nTriviaQA-Wiki formed of the first 400 tokens in documents,\nthat contain at least one of the provided possible answers.\n\nIn this section, we perform ablation experiments\nover a number of facets of BERT in order to better\nunderstand their relative importance.

The BiLSTM hurts\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\nboth left and right context at every layer.\n\n5.2\nEffect of Model Size\n\nablation studies can be found in Appendix C.\n\n5.1\nEffect of Pre-training Tasks\n\nWe demonstrate the importance of the deep bidi-\nrectionality of BERT by evaluating two pre-\ntraining objectives using exactly the same pre-\ntraining data, fine-tuning scheme, and hyperpa-\nrameters as BERTBASE:\n\nNo NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained\nusing the \u201cmasked LM\u201d (MLM) but without the\n\u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d (NSP) task.\nLTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which\nis trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR)\nLM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at fine-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\nsentation, and our fine-tuning scheme.\nWe first examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask.\nIn Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\nparing \u201cNo NSP\u201d to \u201cLTR & No NSP\u201d. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsignificantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\n\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\non fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\ncedure as described previously.\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning.\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\ning examples, and is substantially different from\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\ning that we are able to achieve such significant\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con-\ntains 340M parameters.\nIt has long been known that increasing the\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\nshown in Table 6.\nHowever, we believe that\nthis is the first work to demonstrate convinc-\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\ntasks, provided that the model has been suffi-\nciently pre-trained.

Both of these prior works used a feature-\nbased approach \u2014 we hypothesize that when the\nmodel is fine-tuned directly on the downstream\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\nspecific models can benefit from the larger, more\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\ndownstream task data is very small.\n\n5.3\nFeature-based Approach with BERT\n\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition re-\nsults. Hyperparameters were selected using the Dev\nset. The reported Dev and Test scores are averaged over\n5 random restarts using those hyperparameters.\n\nlayer in the output. We use the representation of\nthe first sub-token as the input to the token-level\nclassifier over the NER label set.\n\nTo ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\ntions from one or more layers without fine-tuning\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classification layer.\n\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both fine-\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\n\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\nthe fine-tuning approach, where a simple classifi-\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\nall parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a down-\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\nwhere fixed features are extracted from the pre-\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\na task-specific model architecture to be added.\nSecond, there are major computational benefits\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\ninclude the maximal document context provided\nby the data. Following standard practice, we for-\nmulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF",

In\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\ndure.\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\npre-training steps may be required for the model\n\nBERT (Ours)\n\nOpenAI GPT\n\nELMo\n\nT1\nT2\nTN\n...\n\nT1\nT2\n TN\n...\n\nT1\nT2\n TN\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nTrm\nTrm\nTrm\n\nTrm\nTrm\nTrm\n\nLstm\n\nLstm\nLstm\n\nLstm\nLstm\nLstm\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nTrm\nTrm\nTrm\n\nTrm\nTrm\nTrm\n\nLstm\nLstm\nLstm\n\nLstm\nLstm\nLstm\n\n...\n\n...\n\nE1\nE2\n EN\n...\n\nE1\nE2\n EN\n...\n\nE1\nE2\n EN\n...\n\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT\nuses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-\nleft LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly\nconditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and\nOpenAI GPT are fine-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\n\nto converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\n\nNext Sentence Prediction\nThe next sentence\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\nexamples.\n\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\n\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\n\nLabel = IsNext\n\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\n\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\n\nLabel = NotNext\n\nA.2\nPre-training Procedure\n\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus.\nWe\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, \u03b21 = 0.9,\n\u03b22 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\nrate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\nlikelihood.\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4\nCloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\npositional embeddings.\n\nA.3\nFine-tuning Procedure\n\nFor fine-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\nare task-specific, but we found the following range\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\n\n\u2022 Batch size: 16, 32\n\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud-\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\navailability.html\n\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\nrefer to as \u201csentences\u201d even though they are typ-\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\nbe shorter also). The first sentence receives the A\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\nsentence, which is done for the \u201cnext sentence pre-\ndiction\u201d task. They are sampled such that the com-\nbined length is \u2264512 tokens. The LM masking is\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\neration given to partial word pieces.\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\n\n\u2022 Learning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\n\u2022 Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4\n\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\n\nA.5\nIllustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\nTasks\n\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\nperforms best on the development set.\n\nA.4\nComparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\nOpenAI GPT\n\nThe illustration of fine-tuning BERT on different\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specific\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In\nthe figure, E represents the input embedding, Ti\nrepresents the contextual representation of token i,\n[CLS] is the special symbol for classification out-\nput, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate\nnon-consecutive token sequences.\n\nB\nDetailed Experimental Setup\n\nB.1\nDetailed Descriptions for the GLUE\nBenchmark Experiments.\n\nOur\nGLUE\nresults\nin\nTable1\nare\nobtained\nfrom\nhttps://gluebenchmark.com/\nleaderboard\nand\nhttps://blog.\nopenai.com/language-unsupervised.\nThe GLUE benchmark includes the following\ndatasets, the descriptions of which were originally\nsummarized in Wang et al. (2018a):\n\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fine-\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\napproach.\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\nwe do note that there are several other differences\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\n\n\u2022 GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\nwords).\n\nMNLI\nMulti-Genre Natural Language Inference\nis a large-scale, crowdsourced entailment classifi-\ncation task (Williams et al., 2018). Given a pair of\nsentences, the goal is to predict whether the sec-\nond sentence is an entailment, contradiction, or\nneutral with respect to the first one.\n\nQQP\nQuora Question Pairs is a binary classifi-\ncation task where the goal is to determine if two\nquestions asked on Quora are semantically equiv-\nalent (Chen et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and\nclassifier token ([CLS]) which are only in-\ntroduced at fine-tuning time; BERT learns\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\ndings during pre-training.\n\n\u2022 GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n\n\u2022 GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\nall fine-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\ntask-specific fine-tuning learning rate which\nperforms the best on the development set.\n\nQNLI\nQuestion Natural Language Inference is\na version of the Stanford Question Answering\nDataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) which has been\nconverted to a binary classification task (Wang\net al., 2018a). The positive examples are (ques-\ntion, sentence) pairs which do contain the correct\nanswer, and the negative examples are (question,\nsentence) from the same paragraph which do not\ncontain the answer.\n\nClass \nLabel\n\nClass \nLabel\n\n...\n\nC\n\nTN\n\nC\n\nT1\n\nT2\n\nT1\n\nTN\n\nT1\u2019\n...\n\nTM\u2019\n\nT[SEP]\n...",

  "abstract_summary": "Unlike recent language repre- sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad- ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre- train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a re- sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine- tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task- specific architecture modifications. It obtains new state-of-the-art re- sults on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer- ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im- provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
  "introduction_summary": "These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re- lationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce fine-grained output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016). To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen- tence words given a representation of the previous sentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto- encoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016). When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specific architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques- tion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).",
